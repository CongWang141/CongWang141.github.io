🐸 I am a final year PhD student in Economics at Sapienza University of Rome.

🎭 Outside my research, I like coding, documentary, and travelling, I will not forget to mention my favorite Italian Spritz!!!

Research Interests
======
📝 My research covers topics in the broad area of Econometrics, mainly in causal inference, machine learning, and their applications in the field of climate finance.

🐝 I Like documentary “Planet Earth”, now [Our Planet](https://www.ourplanet.com/en/) has better quality and the same David Attenborough. Concern about climate change, try to quantify the risk in the financial market and real economy.
