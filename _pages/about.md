PhD student studying Economics at Sapienza University of Rome.

Outside my research, I like coding, documentary, and travelling, I will not forget to mention my favorite Italian Spritz!!!

Aboout myself

My research covers topics in the broad area of Econometrics, especially in causal inference, treatment effect, machine learning, and their applications in the field of climate and environmental economics.

I Like documentary “Planet Earth”, now [Our Planet](https://www.ourplanet.com/en/) has better quality and the same David Attenborough. Concern about climate change, try to quantify the risk in the financial market and real economy.
