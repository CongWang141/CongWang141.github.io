Research Interests
======
My research covers topics in the broad area of Econometrics including:

+ Causal inference

+ Machine learning

+ Empirical studies in climate finance.

I Like documentary “Planet Earth”, now [Our Planet](https://www.ourplanet.com/en/) has better quality and the same David Attenborough. Concern about climate change, try to quantify the risk in the financial market and real economy.
