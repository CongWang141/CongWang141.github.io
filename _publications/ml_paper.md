In the field of empirical asset pricing, the challenge of high dimensionality, non-linear relationships, and interaction effects has led to the increasing popularity of machine learning methods. These methods have primarily been utilized for predicting stock excess returns. However, stock abnormal returns derived from various factor models also hold economic significance. This paper aims to explore the similarities and differences between stock excess returns and abnormal returns derived from different factor models, with a particular focus on employing neural network models for stock return prediction. We find that neural network models perform better when incorporating macroeconomic variables such as the CFNAI index and investor sentiment data. However, the extent of improvement varies depending on the measure of stock return examined. Comparing different measures of stock return, we observe that abnormal returns derived from the CAPM model exhibit the highest similarity to excess returns, while abnormal returns derived from the FF3 and FF5 models display the least similarity to excess returns. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the extent to which the factor models have removed the variance associated with macroeconomics. These findings provide insights into the effectiveness of neural network models in predicting stock returns and contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between factor models, abnormal returns, and excess returns in empirical asset pricing.
